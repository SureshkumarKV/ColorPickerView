# ColorPickerView

ColorPickerView is a fully loaded color picker view for Android that you can use in your dialogs as well as embed into layout files. ColorPickerView is implemented as a subclass of FrameLayout. So it will fit anywhere a regular Android View will go into.

Here is a quick list of the features:
* RGBA picker with or without alpha.
* Hex display to copy the value or manually enter the color as hex.
* A realtime color preview.
* Embedd into any Android layout or dialog.
